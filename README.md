# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using **Create React App**.

## Available Scripts

Within your project directory, you can use the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

- The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
- You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to the section on running tests for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production and outputs it to the `build` folder.

- Bundles React in production mode.
- Optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for cache-busting.

Your app will be ready for deployment.  
See the section on deployment for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you **cannot** revert back!

If you're not satisfied with the default build tool and configuration, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.

- After ejecting, all scripts (except eject) will continue to work, but they will reference the copied files, allowing for further customization.
- Ejecting is optional and is typically not needed for small to medium projects. However, if you require more control over the build process, ejecting is available.
